# Budget Tracker Application

## Proposal

The budget tracker application will maintain a record of 
a user's expenses and income in custom or predetermined categories, as well as allow them to
create a custom budget. Using the created budget, the
application will track expenses and report spending in
each given category for a chosen period (week, month, or year).
These reports will also allow the application to notify the user
on excessive spending or increased savings in each category.

I will use the budget tracker, along with friends and family and
anyone else that comes across it. This project is interesting to me
because I have found most budget trackers online have most of
their features locked behind a subscription paywall. I'd like to
make a simple budget app that I can use for free, since it's difficult
to keep track of a personal budget otherwise.
